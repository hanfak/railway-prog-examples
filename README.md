# Business Flows Example

Examples of using a java libray implementing 'Railway programming'.

Examples:

- Chaining in a functional style, to flow through happy and sad path, and deal with exceptions via technical failures.
- Using Potential failures, to handle sad path only cases where happy path is not neccesary and only care about the sad path.
- Using Happy Path, when need to use both paths to split flow and do next steps.
